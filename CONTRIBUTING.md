## Ground rules and expectations

Before we get started, here are a few things we expect from you (and that you should expect from others):

* Be kind and thoughtful in your conversations around this project. We all come from different backgrounds and projects, which means we likely have different perspectives on "how open source is done." Try to listen to others rather than convince them that your way is correct.
* Everything we do is in accordance with our [Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project, you agree to abide by its terms.
* If you open a pull request, please ensure that your contribution passes all tests. If there are test failures, you will need to address them before we can merge your contribution.
* When adding content, please make sure it links to an official source, if possible. Please don't add references or links to things from a non-government or non-Union webpage unless absolutely necessary.

## How to contribute

If you'd like to contribute, start by searching through the [issues](https://github.com/LocalOPC/LocalOPC.org/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/LocalOPC/LocalOPC.org/pulls) to see whether someone else has raised a similar idea or question.
guide
If you don't see your idea listed, and you think it fits into the goals of our work, do one of the following:
* **If your contribution is minor,** such as a typo fix, open a pull request.
* **If your contribution is major,** such as a new guide, start by opening an issue first. That way, other people can weigh in on the discussion before you do any work.

## Community

Discussions about the Open Source Guides take place on this repository's [Issues](https://github.com/LocalOPC/LocalOPC.org/issues) and [Pull Requests](https://github.com/LocalOPC/LocalOPC.org/pulls) sections. Anybody is welcome to join these conversations.

Wherever possible, do not take these conversations to private channels, including contacting the maintainers directly. Keeping communication public means everybody can benefit and learn from the conversation.
